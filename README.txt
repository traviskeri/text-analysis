1. Aaron Miller and Travis Keri

2. We started the project on 10/16/2017 till 11/3/2017

3. Both of us expected the Hash Table to be the fastest.

4. The hashtable was the fastest, we were correct.

5. It is hard to determine which of these is "better". While the accessing the hash table is faster, but in terms of ease of coding and debugging the AVL would be better.  Also in terms of sorting the data the AVL is also better because you can sort the data while it is in the tree.
   
6. Are there cases in which a particular data structure performs really well or badly in the Correlator? Enumerate the cases for each data structure.

   BST:

   AVL:
   
   Hash Table:   

7. There is some chance that Sir Bacon wrote Shakespeare but most likely not. There have been a lot of people over the years, dating back to the 17th century, that have thought he did. However, it has been proven over and over that it was not him.

8.We measured the time it takes to build the data sturcture and the time to access it. We did this with the System.nanoTime() method. Possible sources of error would be in the accessing benchmark, we are also timing how long it takes to print everthing out which will give us a longer time.

9.I really enjoyed working on that hashtable it was something I had never worked on before so it was fun to figure it out. The main problem that I(Travis) have with this project it that you have forced us to work in groups. The logical way to split up a project like this is by class. That means only one of us is likely going to do the hashtable, the thing we are trying to learn. While the person who works on the other classes my do just as much work they are not learning what is entended for this project. For them to make sure they understand the hashtable they need to write the code themselves. So they end up doing more work than the other person. This is not a class on how to work together in a group it is a class on algorithims and data structures.
